# zyBooks C Language Labs

### by Patricia Antlitz

This repository contains the labs and challenges for the zyBook C language book. This repository was created for my personal need for remote storage.

I am making this available to anyone in case someone needs help with their homework. If you (a student) come across these labs, please kindly reference this repository as a source. Your teacher, professor, or instructor will know if you copied your code from someone else.

This repository is divided into chapters from chapter 1 to chapter 11 (as I work on it). Each chapter folder contains the labs for that chapter and potencially some exercises from the chapter as well.
Feel free to create any issues if you have any questions.

The codes for each lab or exercise in this repository was developed as required by each challenge in order to pass the challenge. They were not developed keeping the user in mind.

Hope you enjoy!
Happy coding!!!!
